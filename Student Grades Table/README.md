This project is an online HTML, CSS and javascript application that manages hypothetical student assignment grades using an online styled table.
The table automatically recalculates the average result of the students assignments when a cell is updated and can be viewed in the right most coloumn.
If the average calculates to be less then 60% the assignment average cell will turn red.
Cells containing erroneous data are set	to being un-submitted meaning any input other that number between 0-100 will be replaced by	a	â€œ-".

Additional features to be added:
Button to add more rows and columns with full functionality 
Grading system to be be preented when one of the average cells are clicked
